# Nacho's Achievements

This mod adds 30 achievements to Lethal Company, with more to come in the future.

All achievements and their progress can be accesed via the pause menu when hosting or joining a save file.

All achievements are tracked independently of which save file you're using and are saved to disk inside `steamapps\common\Lethal Company\BepInEx\config\NachosAchievements`.

If you wish to reset your achievements, either delete `achievements.json` in the folder specified above or enable the debug option. (Make sure to turn this option off if you wish to keep your achievements afterwards!) (This does not include save-dependent achievements, such as the "single run" type of achievement.)

## Why?

I love going for achievements in this type of games (PEAK is a great example), and I always felt Lethal Company should have a system for achievements. So, I made my own.

As of update 1.1.0, I added a way for any mod developer to add their own achievements without code, because I really liked the idea. Documentation for this will be available soon, for now, know that to add achievements to your mod using my mod, you need to create an "achievements.json" file on the root directory of your mod's folder. You can look at achievements.json in this repository to see how this json file should be structured for now.
