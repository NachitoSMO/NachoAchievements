# Nacho's Achievements

This mod adds 50 achievements to Lethal Company, with more to come in the future.

All achievements and their progress can be accesed via the pause menu when hosting or joining a save file.

All achievements are tracked independently of which save file you're using and are saved to disk inside `steamapps\common\Lethal Company\BepInEx\config\NachosAchievements`.

If you wish to reset your achievements, either delete `advancements.json` in the folder specified above or enable the debug option. (Make sure to turn this option off if you wish to keep your achievements afterwards!)

## Why?

I love going for achievements in this type of games (PEAK is a great example), and I always felt Lethal Company should have a system for achievements. So, I made my own.
